- in your workspace click on 'Download all' and copy the auth .json in root of this project
- run `aio app use <filename>` 
- this should populate the `.env` and the `.aio` file in the project root
- ask a colleague for values:
    - for health-check action, 
    add ODIN_CDN_ENDPOINT,ODIN_ORIGIN_ENDPOINT,WCS_CDN_ENDPOINT,WCS_ORIGIN_ENDPOINT env vars to .env file
    - for ost-products, add AOS_URL and AOS_API_KEY env vars to .env file
